The basic assumption for this model is as follows:
survivability depends on different factors and assumed at the beginning as 100 as basic ( 100% survived)
then the factors are added, e.g. female survivability rate is higher, than male, same for minors higher, that adults etc.
since such factors are independent from each other in their nature, but all linked towards survivability, the latter is a multiplication of all factors taken into account
The model implies Pclass, Gender, Age, Sibsp, Parch and Embarkment as factors.
No data fillna applied since NA data in Age (where NaNs are) has an impact on survivability
Cabin, name and Fare are not (yet?) included into the calculation since they do not display to have impact on the survivability or in this or that form is already included into computation.
